# Is the Blue Line down?
This is the source code for a website I hacked together when I was bored on a Saturday. I figured it's a good idea to put it in source control as a few people have suggested I add features. This project uses VanillaJS, and is hosted on Firebase

The website has a very simple purpose: Checking if the CTA Blue Line is... to put it politely... 'down'.
